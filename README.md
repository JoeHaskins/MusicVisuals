# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Joseph Haskins

Student Number: C18336951

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
This program loads a file of the mp3 format from the java/data folder and then runs and displays shapes and images that respond to various parts of the audio.

# Instructions
The program has 4 modes each displaying a diffrent form of audio visualiser. These can be toggled using the keys 1,2,3 and 4. The current mode of the program is displayed in the top left corner. The program can also be restarted by pressing the "Space" key without changing the mode back to the default.

# How it works
You can run the project by opening the file in VS code and pressing F5 or you can open a console in the java file and type ./run.sh. If for some reason the .class files didnt download
correctly you can type ./compile.sh in that same folder then re-try ./run.sh.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
